## Experiment 1:Implimentation of input and output code in c++

##  Aim: *Hello World* and *Simple Calculator* Program in C++

### Tools:
- **Visual Studio**

###  Theory:

In C++, **input and output (I/O)** are handled using **streams**, which are essentially sequences of bytes that flow between the program and input/output devices.

- **Input Stream:**  
  When data flows **from an input device** (like the **keyboard**) into the computer's memory, it's handled as an **input stream**.

- **Output Stream:**  
  When data flows **from memory to an output device** (like the **display screen**), itâ€™s managed as an **output stream**.

These I/O operations in C++ are performed using objects defined in the **``** header file.

#### ðŸ”¹ Standard Output â€“ `cout`:
- `cout` is used to send output to the screen.
- It uses the **insertion operator (`>`)** to read and store values into variables.

###  Implementation:

The following basic C++ programs demonstrate:

1. **"Hello World"** â€“ A simple program to print text on the screen.
2. **Basic Calculator** â€“ A program to perform **arithmetic operations** like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

These examples help explore:
- Basic syntax of C++
- Use of `cin` and `cout`
- Arithmetic operators

### ðŸ§¾ Conclusion:

Through the "Hello World" and Calculator examples, core concepts of C++â€”like input and output handling and basic arithmetic operationsâ€”have been introduced. These foundation blocks are essential for building more complex programs in C++.
